# MS-Rewards-Collector

This extension is capable of automatically collect most of the basic challenges that MS rewards uses.

Can collect:

- Daily challenges
- Daily bonus challenges (the one at the bottom of the page)
- Search with Bing points.

2. Search engine: Bing.

This extension does **not** access your personal data, its just a script that automates certain challenges.

2. Unzip the archive in a folder anywhere you want.
3. Go on your browser and search in the URL tab:  $\text {edge://extensions}$ to access your extension page.
4. Enable developer mode

6. Select the folder that you unzipped in the previous steps and youâ€™re done.

If you have done everything correctly (at page loaded) you should have these two buttons:

Keep in mind that for the correct use of the extension you'll need to enable popups on that page if required by the browser.
Everything is tested in the Italian page of microsoft rewards.
